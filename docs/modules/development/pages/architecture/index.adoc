= Architecture

Mizer is built with a combination of modules on top of a main loop.

Each module can provide multiple processors which can hook into different stages of the main loop life cylce.

The main loop is composed of three stages:

* pre_process
* process
* post_process

Each processor can define a priority for each hook to control in which order they are executed.

Everything, even the node graph, is running as part of a processor.

The node graph runs with the following priorities:

|===
|Stage |Priority

|Pre Process |-50

|Process |0

|Post Process |50
|===
