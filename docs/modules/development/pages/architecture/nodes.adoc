= Nodes

Each node is composed of multiple parts

// TODO: which parts of this documentation should be moved into rust docs?
// Can we include or link rust docs in this documentation as well?

== Configuration

A basic struct which will be (de-)serialized to the project file.

== ConfigurableNode trait

This trait is composed of two methods which make the configuration available to the user in the ui.

The `settings` method can return a list of `NodeSetting`s which describe a configuration option.

Each `NodeSetting` is composed of at least an `id` and a `value`. It's recommended to use the `setting!` macro to define each setting as it automatically creates the `NodeSetting` struct and is also able to derive the value type out of the given field.

When no `label` is defined the `id` is also what will be shown to the user in the node settings pane.

Settings can be marked as `optional` and `disabled` if necessary.

The `value` also contains any options or parameter which might be necessary for the ui to allow proper configuration.

=== NodeSettingValue::Text

Plaintext input. Can support multiple lines with the `multiline` flag.

=== NodeSettingValue::Float

Will display a slider in the ui supporting arbitrary floating values.

The `min` and `max` options configure the supported value range while `min_hint` and `max_hint` configure the start and end point of the slider.
The `step_size` is used when scrolling on the slider.

=== NodeSettingValue::Uint

Will display a slider in the ui supporting 32bit unsigned integers.

The `min` and `max` options configure the supported value range while `min_hint` and `max_hint` configure the start and end point of the slider.
The `step_size` is used when scrolling on the slider.

=== NodeSettingValue::Int

Will display a slider in the ui supporting 64bit signed integers.

The `min` and `max` options configure the supported value range while `min_hint` and `max_hint` configure the start and end point of the slider.
The `step_size` is used when scrolling on the slider.

=== NodeSettingValue::Bool

Displays a checkbox in the ui.

=== NodeSettingValue::Select

Displays a dropdown in the ui.

The `variant` option configures the available options. These can be nested as well.

=== NodeSettingValue::Enum

Displays a dropdown in the ui.

The Enum value can be auto-generated from any rust `enum` as long as it implements the `enum_iterator::Sequence`, `Into<u8>` and `Display` traits.

=== NodeSettingValue::Id

Displays a dropdown in the ui.

This differs to the `Select` value in only supporting `u32` values and not supporting nesting.

=== NodeSettingValue::Spline

Shows a spline editor in the ui.

=== NodeSettingValue::Media

Shows a media selector in the ui.

With the `content_type` option the supported media type can be configured.

=== NodeSettingValue::Steps

Shows a step sequencer in the ui.

== PipelineNode trait

This trait describes the node interface of this node.

This includes

* the name of the node type
* the node type
* the preview type
* the category
* an optional display name
* the list of inputs and outputs

== ProcessingNode trait

This trait describes the actual implementation of the node.
For processing every node can create a state object which will always be kept running in the same instance and does not have to be thread safe.

A node can run code in all three processing stages (pre_process, process, post_process).
Nodes will be executed based on the dependencies defined by the node links.
Execution order is not deterministic as the node pipeline is composed of multiple small graphs which could be run in any order.

The `ProcessingNode` trait also allows you to define templates for different Configurations.

The `debug_ui` method can be implemented as well which allows to add node internals to the egui debug ui available on Linux.
